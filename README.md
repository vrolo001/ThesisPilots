Participants were told they would be reading an article detailing current trends in one of four areas: religion, politics,
medicine, or sexuality and asked some questions about their assigned topic. In reality, all participants were randomly assigned to read 
a sexuality article. Information in this sexuality article was manipulated to create three sexuality conditions:
1) high sexuality condition (women these days are having sex at earlier ages, with more partners, and trying more variety than 
   women in the past)
2) low sexuality condition (women these days are having sex at later ages, with fewer partners, and trying less variety than women
   in the past)
3) control condition (women these days are having sex at similar ages, with same average number of partners, and with same variety to
   women in the past)

Before they were shown the article, participants completed the Revised Sociosexuality Inventory (SOI-R; Penke, 2011) to measure their
own sociosexuality (SOI), meaning their tendencies to engage in sexual relationships without emotional commitment. Participants were then
randomly assigned to one of the three conditions detailed above. After reading their assigned article, they were given a 4-question
reading comprehension test. In all 3 conditions, the correct answers to this test were True-True-False-True. The next section then 
asked participants to write one or two sentences about 3 women that they either new personally (preferably) or that they had heard about
who behaved in line with their assigned condition (e.g., participants in the high sexuality condition were asked to write about 3 women
who behaved more sexually than women in the past, according to the information from their assigned article). Participants were then asked 
to give their own perceptions of how sexual they believed women in their society to be by completing a modified version of the SOI-R phrased
in the third-person (e.g., the item "I think sex without love is OK" was changed to "Women in my society think sex without love is OK"). They
then completed scales for sexual morality (Asao, 2017), self-reigiosity, and imposed religiosity on others. Self-religiosity was measured
with a 6-item scale (sample item, "My personal religious beliefs are very important to me."), whereas imposed religiosity on others was
measured using a 5-item scale that adapted some items from the religious commitment inventory (RCI-10; Worthington et al., 2003; sample item,
"People in my society would be better off if religion played a bigger role in their lives."). Finally, they completed some demographics and
were debriefed about the true nature of the study, at which point they were given the option to withdraw their data from the study.

Exclusion criteria included:
1) Asking to have their data withdrawn 
2) Failing any of the two attention checks throughout the survey
3) Failing 2 or more items on the reading comprehension test
4) Being international students (as we wanted participants who were well acquainted and integrated into the UK)
5) Identifying as non-heterosexual and/or non cisgender (our hypohteses focused on heterosexual, cisgender behaviour. While research into 
   sexual minorities is important, many of our hypotheses were exploratory in nature, and we thought it best to first explore these with
   regards to whether effects are present in heterosexual cisgender participants before hypothesising whether any significant effects would
   also be present in sexual and gender minorities.
